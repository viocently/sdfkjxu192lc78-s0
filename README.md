This is the source code for the paper "Massive Superpoly Recovery with a
Meet-in-the-middle Framework -- Improved Cube Attacks on Trivium and Kreyvium".

The file "Codes" contains the source code.
The file "KreyviumSuperpoly" contains the superpolies of Kreyvium. 

For example, the file "896_I1" is the 896-round superpoly of the cube indices $I_1$; each line in this file is a monomial (e.g., "s0s1" is the monomial $k[0]k[1]$)
